<p align="center"> The profile of ENFYCIUS</p>

:wave: Hello, I'm JongHyeok Kim, and I majored in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Hanbat National University in South Korea. I am excited to share that I have recently been accepted into the Master's program at [Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)'s School of Mechanical and Robotics Engineering (MRE)](./assets/images/gist/gist.png). I will be conducting my research under the guidance of Professor Hyunseok Oh in his lab.

I am incredibly grateful and excited to have the opportunity to become a graduate student at GIST. Although my cousin, who is currently working as a senior researcher at Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), pursued a different field in Computer Science, I am honored to follow a similar academic path at GIST. You can find his research work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aW7jSykAAAAJ&hl=ko) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ju-Won-Park).

Additionally, I am thrilled to announce that I have also been accepted as a government scholarship recipient for the Master's program in Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST). This recent achievement adds to my excitement as I look forward to the next chapter of my academic journey.

I've been researching deep learning at the ConstructionIT lab and previously researched it at the Department of Basic Science, Hanbat National University.

Especially, based on deep learning, in the former lab, we'd been conducting research to detect extent of damage to the mooring facility until early 2023. As well as, as part of that research, I developed a ROS-based construction robot to perform such tasks in 2022. In the latter lab, an inverse problem, in science, is the process of calculating from a set of observations the causal factors that produced them, was selected as the topic of our research and we were studying it using **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** for about a year and a half. Even though it didn't result in any tangible breakthroughs, it was a rare glimpse into the intersection of artificial intelligence and math.

Previously, I conducted various research in the fields of ConstructionIT, ROS-based robotics, sensor fusion, and the integration of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Additionally, I participated in programs such as ‘소중한 봉사단’ and ‘Herald’ at Hanbat National University to further enhance my skills. I also taught Python, Android, machine learning, and deep learning to 17 students.

> Teaching is the beginning of **enlightenment** !

> Also, I see teaching as another learning opportunity and a chance to be at the forefront of education.

Now that these activities have come to an end, I am focusing on leveraging these experiences to plan new research and projects for the future.

These days I'm hosting a live broadcast on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@enfycius0131?feature=shared) titled "스터디윗미(Study with me)(Civil Engineering & Mathematics & Coding)". Alongside my academic pursuits, I've also taken up golf recently, which has become a great way for me to relax and challenge myself outside of the lab. If you're curious, you can check out one of my golf videos here: [Watch my golf video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sSYykzI_kU)

During my internship, I was fortunate to attend the lab’s year-end party.
Prior to the party, we held a Secret Santa event, and I was able to guess who had given me my gift based on the thoughtful choice.
The gift turned out to be an Apple polishing cloth—something I had been wanting for a long time but hesitated to purchase due to its price.
To my great surprise, the senior who played the role of my Secret Santa seemed to understand my unspoken wish, just like a real Santa Claus, and prepared the perfect gift for me.
I couldn’t have been happier to discover that this was my gift.

As I correctly guessed who my Secret Santa was, the professor rewarded me with a Starbucks coupon.
Additionally, the professor generously gave each of us another Starbucks coupon as a separate gift for the lab members.

![Secret Santa](./assets/images/internships/GIST/Secret-santa.png)

One particularly memorable moment during the year-end party was when we gathered at a café after the main dinner to reflect on the year.
Taking turns, each of us shared our thoughts and experiences.
I expressed how grateful and joyful I felt to have been part of the SDDO lab this year.
Thanks to the warm support of the professor and the wonderful lab members, the SDDO lab felt like a cozy haven, even during the cold winter season.
