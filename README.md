:wave: Hello, I'm JongHyeok Kim, and I majored in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Hanbat National University in South Korea.

I've been researching deep learning at the ConstructionIT lab and previously researched it at the Department of Basic Science, Hanbat National University.

Especially, based on deep learning, in the former lab, we'd been conducting research to detect extent of damage to the mooring facility until early 2023. As well as, as part of that research, I developed a ROS-based construction robot to perform such tasks in 2022. In the latter lab, An inverse problem, in science, is the process of calculating from a set of observations the causal factors that produced them, was selected as the topic of our research and we were studying it using **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** for about a year and a half. Even though it didn't result in any tangible breakthroughs, it was a rare glimpse into the intersection of artificial intelligence and math.

Currently, I have been conducting various research attempts in the field of civil engineering, which is my main major and interests, in the fields of ConstructionIT, ROS-based robot, and sensor fusion by combining computer vision and artificial intelligence. In addition, I have recently joined various programs such as "소중한 봉사단", "Herald", and so forth at Hanbat National University to strengthen my skills.

Also, I recently started coding tutoring. I have about 9 students so far. I mainly teach students the Python language and partly android, as well as machine learning and deep learning.

I see teaching as another learning opportunity and a chance to be at the forefront of education. 

Recently, I rejoined the previous ConstructionIT lab, where I am getting ready for the 14th LH competition.

> Teaching is the beginning of enlightenment !

These days I'm hosting a live broadcast on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@enfycius0131?feature=shared) titled "스터디윗미(Study with me)(Civil Engineering & Mathematics & Coding)".

We are the Guardians Team that help each other out, collaborate, and move forward.

Our journey has just begun, and with every step we take, we want to enrich the past and prepare for the future.

Being composed of different majors allows us to look at what we are trying to do from different perspectives, which we believe will play to our strengths.

### 💡 Tip

If you're having trouble solving the problem, try the following, as I did.

Originally, I used to take a walk when I had problems that were not solved or blocked, but recently, I have often driven with [my recently purchased car](./assets/images/my_car/)

> Taking a walk is the best solution for a healthy body and a healthy mind.

> Driving with the windows open will bring you back to a clear mind with fresh air!

### 🧘 Faith

I've always been fascinated by the idea of pioneering a field by oneself, without anyone else's help. If I had to pick one trait that is most important to me, I would say it is capacity of staying the flow.

From the moment we are born with a brain, I think that the most important activity of being human is using it.

I basically enjoy interacting with people, and the pleasure I get from that is immeasurable.
