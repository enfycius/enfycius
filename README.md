:wave: Hello, I'm JongHyeok Kim, an senior undergraduate student at Hanbat National University in South Korea.

Previously, I investigated deep learning at the ConstructionIT lab and at the department of basic science, Hanbat National University.

Especially, based on deep learning, in the former lab, we'd been conducting research to detect extent of damage to the mooring facility until early 2023. As well as, as part of that research, I developed a ROS-based construction robot to perform such tasks in 2022. In the latter lab, An inverse problem, in science, is the process of calculating from a set of observations the causal factors that produced them, was selected as the topic of our research and we were studying it using **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** for about a year and a half. Even though it didn't result in any tangible breakthroughs, it was a rare glimpse into the intersection of artificial intelligence and math.

Currently, I have been conducting various research attempts in the field of civil engineering, which is my main major and interests, in the fields of ConstructionIT, ROS-based robot, and sensor fusion by combining computer vision and artificial intelligence. In addition, I have recently joined various programs such as "ÏÜåÏ§ëÌïú Î¥âÏÇ¨Îã®", "Herald", and so forth at Hanbat National University to strengthen my skills.

Also, I recently started coding tutoring. I have about 9 students so far. I mainly teach students the Python language and partly android, as well as machine learning and deep learning.

I see teaching as another learning opportunity and a chance to be at the forefront of education. 

Recently, I rejoined the previous ConstructionIT lab, where I am getting ready for the 14th LH competition.

> Teaching is the beginning of enlightenment !

> I love these members. I sincerely hope that they will continue to strive in various fields and reach their dreams.

### üí° Tip

If you're having trouble solving the problem, try the following, as I did.

Originally, I used to take a walk when I had problems that were not solved or blocked, but recently, I have often driven with [my recently purchased car](./assets/images/my_car/).

> Taking a walk is the best solution for a healthy body and a healthy mind.

> Driving with the windows open will bring you back to a clear mind with fresh air!

### üßò Faith

I've always been fascinated by the idea of pioneering a field by oneself, without anyone else's help. If I had to pick one trait that is most important to me, I would say it is capacity of staying the flow.

From the moment we are born with a brain, I think that the most important activity of being human is using it.

I basically enjoy interacting with people, and the pleasure I get from that is immeasurable.

### :fountain: Acknowledgements

> Getting the opportunity to learn from a Guru in a field is one of the greatest joys and blessings in life.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor [Jaemin Shin](https://sites.google.com/site/jaeminshin3/), who laid the foundation for all my learning.

Next, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my professors in the Department of Civil Engineering at Hanbat National University for their encouragement and assistance in helping me learn Civil Engineering smoothly.

In particular, I would like to thank Prof. [Haemin Jeon](https://haeminjeon.wixsite.com/hbnu), who has been very helpful in my career. To whom I will be eternally grateful. 

Also, I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. [Jongseok Lee](http://cafe.hanbat.ac.kr/cafe/19961001/) for always believing in, supporting me and caring about me. 

Moreover, I would like to thank Professor [Taehwa Jung](https://sites.google.com/site/taehwajung/) for not only recognizing my potential and providing me with opportunities, such as arranging an internships at Korea University during the winter vacation, but also for always reminding me of the truth of learning.

Finally, I would like to thank my old crush, Lee Da-yoon, who is now my girlfriend again, for always being there to support me whenever I am struggling.

This is my dream space, future and space for only her ‚ù§Ô∏è.
